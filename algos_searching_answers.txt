1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

Looking at an attendant name list. 


2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

Looking at a departures time screen in a rail station. 


3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search? 

You need six iterations. 


4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

You need three iterations.


5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

As nothing is sorted, there is no way we can use a binary search. Therefore I would go for a linear search. 


6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

I would definitely use a binary search as number too find could be excessively huge, let's 980 001 for instance. With a linear search that would mean the same number of iterations.


Programming questions

1. ou and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

let recursiveFunction = function (arr, x, start, end) {
  if (start > end) return false; 
  let mid=Math.floor((start + end)/2);
  if (arr[mid]===x) return true; 
  if (arr[mid] > x)
     return recursiveFunction(arr, x, start, mid-1);
  else
     return recursiveFunction(arr, x, mid+1, end);
}

let arr = ["Alabama", "Alambic", "Albatros", "Bravo", "Charlie"];
let x = "Albatros";

if (recursiveFunction(arr, x, 0, arr.length-1)) 
    document.write("Element found!<br>"); 
else document.write("Element not found!<br>"); 



2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

var answer = 'not found';

function LinearSearch(A,n,searchQuery) {
  for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if( A[i] === searchQuery) {
      return 'found';
    }
  }
  return answer
}

var names = ["Red", "Blue", "Yellow", "White", "Black"]

console.log(LinearSearch(names, names.length, "White"));
